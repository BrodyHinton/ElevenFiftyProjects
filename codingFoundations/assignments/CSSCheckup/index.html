    <h2>Wild Card Predictions</h2>
    <wildCard id="wildCard">
        <h3>Cleveland Guardians vs Tampa Bay Rays</h3>
        <p>This series is an interesting one, two of the best managers in the league facing each other with Terry Francona vs Kevin Cash. This could go either way but I'll go with Tampa Bay since they're known for being highly underestimated in the regular season.</p>
        <h4>Pick: Tampa Bay Rays</h4>
        <h3>Toronto Blue Jays vs Seattle Mariners</h3>
        <p>The Mariners finally have made the postseason and will finally play their first series in 21 years. Unfortuately, the good vibes in Seattle most likely won't last for long since the Blue Jays have too much talent for them to overcome.</p>
        <h4>Pick: Toronto Blue Jays</h4>
        <h3>St. Louis Cardinals vs Philadelphia Phillies</h3>
        <p>The Cardinals have been hot recently and have a team that can win it all. Let's just say I'll be very surprised if the Phillies move on.</p>
        <h4>Pick: St. Louis Cardinals</h4>
        <h3>New York Mets vs San Diego Padres</h3>
        <p>The Mets have the dream pitchers for a wild card series. In order for the Padres to win this series they are required to win at least a game with either DeGrom or Scherzer starting.</p>
        <h4>Pick: New York Mets</h4>
    </wildCard>

    <h2>Divsional Series Predictions</h2>
    <divisionSeries id="divisionSeries">
        <h3>New York Yankees vs Tampa Bay Rays</h3>
        <p>The Yankees, although falling through a mid-season slump, have the high-end talent required to easily get past a team like Tampa.</p>
        <h4>Pick: New York Yankees</h4>
        <h3>Houston Astros vs Toronto Blue Jays</h3>
        <p>I like the Toronto Blue Jays, them and the Cardinals are my two dark horses to win the championship. But the Astros may be the best team in the league, for now I'll go with them.</p>
        <h4>Pick: Houston Astros</h4>
        <h3>Atlanta Braves vs St. Louis Cardinals</h3>
        <p>A series that is very similar to the Blue Jays vs Astros one, a dark horse team going against a powerhouse. But the world series hangover will finally catchup to the Braves and the Cardinals will shock everyone by moving on.</p>
        <h4>Pick: St. Louis Cardinals</h4>
        <h3>Los Angeles Dodgers vs New York Mets</h3>
        <p>The Mets have a really good starting rotation which will do wonders for them in the playoffs. But as far as everyone is healthy, nothing is coming between a Braves vs Dodgers rematch in the NL Championship.</p>
        <h4>Pick: Los Angeles Dodgers</h4>
    </divisionSeries>

    <h2>Championship Series Predictions</h2>
    <championshipSeries id="championshipSeries">
        <h3>American League: Houston Astros vs New York Yankees</h3>
        <p>The Yankees in their last two series meetups with the Astros dynasty have ended in failure. This could be the year they break through, but the Astros have barely any weaknesses in contrary to the Yankees. Also the Yankees have been very up-and-down throughout the season unlike the Astros who have stayed steadily good throughout the year.</p>
        <h4>Pick: Houston Astros</h4>
        <h3>National League: Los Angeles Dodgers vs St. Louis Cardinals</h3>
        <p>This is where I think the Cardinals run ends. The Dodgers statistically have the best team in the league and the best team in Dodgers history. They have dominated everything in their path this season and I don't think they're stopping here.</p>
        <h4>Pick: Los Angeles Dodgers</h4>
    </championshipSeries>

    <h2>World Series Predictions</h2>
    <worldSeries id="worldSeries">
      <h3>Los Angeles Dodgers vs Houston Astros</h3>
      <div class="worldseriesTeams">
        <a id="dodgers" href="./assets/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_Logo.svg.png" target="_blank"

          ><img src="./assets/i.png" alt="houston astros logo"
        /></a>
      <p>This is a rematch of the 2017 World Series, where the Astros were supreme over the slightly favored Dodgers in 7 games. This series will be similar in the case of the two best teams in their respective leagues facing off against each other. This time, the Dodgers will get their revenge and take their 2nd championship in the past 3 years</p>
      <h4>Pick: Dodgers in 6</h4>
    </worldSeries>
